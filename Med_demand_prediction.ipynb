    "## Project: Medication Demand Prediction \n",
    "\n",
    "### Accurately predicting medication demand is crucial for ensuring a steady supply of essential drugs and preventing shortages. Various factors, such as flu outbreaks, allergy seasons, and social trends, influence the demand for different medications across regions. By analyzing historical data and external factors, machine learning can help forecast demand patterns, allowing healthcare providers and pharmacies to optimize inventory and reduce waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this project, you will use machine learning models to analyze trends and make predictions about medication demand. Your goal is to explore how different factors—such as seasonal illnesses, regional variations, and social behavior—impact the consumption of medications. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling, you will build a robust forecasting system that can assist in supply chain management for the pharmaceutical industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### You are required to:\n",
    "1. Perform EDA to identify key demand patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Engineer features based on seasonal trends and external influences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Train machine learning models to predict demand across different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Present findings through a well-documented Jupyter Notebook and a final presentation.\n",
